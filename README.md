## üìÑ Overview

This project explores how machine learning can approximate solutions to the **Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF)** problem ‚Äî a fundamental but computationally intensive task in power system operation. The work compares **Neural Networks (NNs)**, **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)**, and **Linear Regression (LR)** across IEEE standard test cases.

The goal is to provide insights into the feasibility, accuracy, and runtime of data-driven OPF surrogates for **near real-time applications**, especially under varying grid sizes and complexity.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ ACOPF solved using [pandapower](https://www.pandapower.org/) on multiple IEEE benchmark networks
- ‚úÖ Clean modular codebase with support for:
  - Neural Network model training and tuning
  - GMM clustering with error estimation
  - Baseline Linear Regression
- ‚úÖ Hyperparameter grid search with early stopping
- ‚úÖ Evaluation across five test systems (30-bus to GB-reduced)
- ‚úÖ Extensible framework for future researchers

## üìò Paper Summary

**Main Contributions:**

- A reproducible pipeline to extract input-output mappings from ACOPF solutions:  
(P_d, Q_d) ‚Üí (P_g, V_g)

- Comparative analysis of NN, GMM, and LR across 5 power networks:
  - üèÜ NNs perform best in large/highly nonlinear grids
  - üìà LR is surprisingly strong in small systems
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è GMMs struggle with high-dimensional data

- MSE benchmarking on scaled data  
- Discussion of **feasibility, generalization**, and **real-time deployment risks**

## üß† Model Architecture

The neural network model learns a mapping from load demands to optimal generator setpoints using a feedforward structure.

The core approximation learned is:

(P_d, Q_d) ‚Üí (P_g, V_g)

Where:
- \( P_d, Q_d \) are the active and reactive power demands at load buses (inputs)
- \( P_g, V_g \) are the generator real power outputs and voltage magnitudes at generator buses (outputs)

Each architecture is tuned using grid search on:

- **Learning rate**
- **Batch size**
- **Hidden layer width/depth**
- **Dropout rate**
- **Patience for early stopping**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LIMESS-Sustainability-Lab/Towards-ML-for-OPF.git
cd Towards-ML-for-OPF
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On Linux/Mac
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

The main script `opf-runner.py` can be run directly:

```bash
python opf-runner.py
```

This will:
1. Generate up to 300 OPF scenarios for multiple OPF scheme test cases
2. Train and evaluate different models (Neural Network, GMM-GMR, Linear Regression)
3. Output the results showing performance on test sets

The script includes several test cases:
- case30
- case_ieee30
- case39
- case118
- GBreducednetwork

## üìÉ Requirements

The project requires Python 3.8 or higher and the following packages:
- pandapower>=2.14.0
- scikit-learn>=1.3.0
- matplotlib>=3.7.0
- numpy>=1.24.0
- torch>=2.0.0
- pandas>=2.0.0

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed using pip as shown in the installation instructions.

## üìå Known Limitations

- Only a single ACOPF sample is used per case ‚Üí no time-series/load diversity  
- No physics-aware features beyond load inputs  
- NN feasibility violations possible without post-processing  
- GMM scalability limited in high-dimensional settings
